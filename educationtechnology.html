        <p>Modern educational technology can improve access to education, including full degree programs.It enables better integration for non-full-time students, particularly
             in continuing education, and improved interactions between students and instructors. Learning material can be used for long-distance learning and are accessible 
             to a wider audience.Course materials are easy to access. In 2010, 70.3% of American family households had access to the internet. In 2013, according 
             to Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission Canada, 79% of homes have access to the internet. Students can access and engage with numerous 
             online resources at home. Using online resources can help students spend more time on specific aspects of what they may be learning in school but at home. Schools 
             like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have made certain course materials free online. Although some aspects of a classroom setting are missed 
             by using these resources, they are helpful tools to add additional support to the educational system. The necessity to pay for transport to the educational facility is removed.</p>
